## Wins
- Forming my data as an object (as opposed to an array and using iterator methods) and manipulating it with new methods!
- The styling of the card, it was a lot of fun to nail the hover transitions.

## Challenges
- Trying to teach myself how to ditch iterator methods and manipulate objects like I would an array! I definetly gave myself a tight schedule to research and implement new techniques to manipulate my data.
- Specifically challenging to the just one property within a nested object. It took me some time to find out which methods to use so my property nested within my object was updated and not overwriting the whole object. Now that I have it figured out I'm definetly more eager to work with objects in the future.
